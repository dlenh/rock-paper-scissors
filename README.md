I have learned how to set up a branch and make changes to it before merging with the main. Refactoring the old code was challenging, but rewarding. Before, the game was only playable through the console. I added another level of complexity to the code by creating a separate array of images (Pokemon starters) for the computer to choose from once a type (grass, fire, water) was selected. This provided me addition practice with array methods and writing dry code. The HTML was simple, but it was difficult making the images responsive with CSS; I had to use relative units instead of hardcoding.
